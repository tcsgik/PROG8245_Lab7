## Data Source: 

This project uses a sample from the 20 Newsgroups dataset, a well-known collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. It is widely used for experiments in text classification and clustering.

Source: sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups

Subset Used: All categories, with headers, footers, and quoted text removed to reduce noise.
